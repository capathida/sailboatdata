# sailingdata

This is just a small test to compare polar diagrams with different sailboats
First just compare the total speed in all wind directions

Suggested improvements
Differentiate different speed in different winds and angles
Compare hullspeed with polar diagram
Add support for more data about the boats, like SA/DISP, Comfort, Disp/Len, Bal/Disp, Capsize value and price
